# Handwritten-Mathematical-Expression-Recognizer

 One of the most challenging applications of pattern recognition in deep learning is handwriting recognition. In many fields, including education, engineering, and science, handwritten mathematical expression recognition is helpful. The crux of the issue is recognizing handwritten mathematical formulas written on a tablet or a computer using a mouse. Since many internet programs and websites use handwritten mathematical expressions, they are frequently used. The state-of-the-art model described in this study detects the mathematical statement from the GUI that is produced in real-time with a mouse or pen. A CNN architecture with numerous layers that was trained using a dataset of mathematical digits and symbols makes up the suggested design
